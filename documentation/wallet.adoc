== Product Overview

=== Purpose and Objective

The primary goal of the Massa Wallet module is to provide a user-friendly and secure way for users to manage their wallet accounts on the Massa blockchain. 
Its key objective is to enable users to securely sign operations when interacting with the Massa blockchain. 
This functionality can be initiated within the module or in response to requests from decentralized applications through the https://github.com/massalabs/wallet-provider[Wallet Provider] library, or from other Massa Station modules. 
Additionally, the module simplifies tasks like checking MAS coin balances, sending and receiving MAS coins, and handling fungible token assets, 
following the https://github.com/massalabs/massa-standards/tree/main/smart-contracts/assembly/contracts/FT[Fungible Token standard].

=== Key Features
1. **Create an account**
(key pairs, password, account name)
2. **Import an account** 
3. **Delete an account**
4. **Back-up an account** (using the private key-pair or the .yaml wallet-account file)
5. **Sign operations**
6. **Sign messages**
7. **Access MASSA balance**
8. **Send and receive MASSA**
9. **Import fungible tokens** 
10. **Access fungible token balances**

=== Architecture Overview
Highlight the main components (API, front-end...) and briefly describe how the end user will interact with the product.

=== User Base
Identify the primary users of the Massa Station Wallet and mention the common use cases.

== Functional Requirements

=== API

The API will adhere to the HTML REST JSON standard, utilizing classic HTTP responses to indicate the status and nature of each response.

NOTE: For hands-on testing and examples, refer to the provided Swagger documentation and consider using tools like Postman.

==== Sign Operation

The 'sign' endpoint serves the purpose of signing all five operation 
types, including Transaction, Roll buy/sell, CallSC, and 
ExecuteSC. It provides the capability to batch operation requests by 
utilizing the correlationID parameter. No user interaction is required once first operation processing is underway. 
Batching operation requests in Massa Wallet does not entail processing the operations as a group. 
Instead, it enhances the user experience by allowing users to, sequentially, sign multiple operations 
after being prompted to provide a password once.

===== Parameters

[%header,cols="1,3,1,1"]
|===
| Name | Description | Presence | Format
| `nickname` | Identifier for the account. | Required | String
| `description` | Text describing the signing intent. | Optional | String (Default: "", Max: 280 characters)
| `operation` | Serialized attributes for signing. | Required | Byte array
| `batch` | Specifies if the operation is part of a batch. | Optional | Boolean (Default: `false`)
| `correlationId` | Identifier for correlating multiple requests. | Optional | String (Default: "")
|===


IMPORTANT: To ensure security, the `correlationId` should be sent in the request body, not in the query string.

===== Response

The correlationId will be included if the batch parameter is set to true.

[%header,cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| Name | Description  | Format
| `signature` | The signature of the signed message | String
| `publicKey` | The public key of the account | String
| `correlationId` | Correlation id of the operation batch | String
|===


==== Sign Message

This endpoint facilitates the signing of a message using a 
specific account resource, identified by its unique nickname. It's 
important to note that this endpoint is not idempotent: identical 
calls with the same data will initiate separate executions.

===== Parameters

[%header,cols="1,3,1,1"]
|===
| Name | Description | Presence | Format
| `nickname` | Identifier for the account. | Required | String
| `description` | Text describing the signing intent. | Optional | String (Default: "", Max: 280 characters)
| `message` | The message to sign | Required | String
| `displayData` | Whether to display data in the prompt | Optional | Boolean
|===


===== Response

[%header,cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| Name | Description  | Format
| `signature` | The signature of the signed message | String
| `publicKey` | The public key of the account | String
| `correlationId` | Correlation id of the operation batch | String
|===

=== Functions

==== Validate Arguments

This function ensures that arguments provided to any endpoint are correct and conform to the expected format. It checks for the presence of required parameters, validates data types, and ensures compliance with any constraints or limits.

==== Account Data

Account data is persistently stored on the file system. The structure and format of this data must strictly adhere to the standards outlined in the Massa Labs documentation, specifically the wallet file format standard available https://github.com/massalabs/massa-standards/blob/main/wallet/file-format.md[here].

==== Password Input

This function captures the user's password input. It is designed with flexibility in mind, accommodating both manual user entry and automated input for testing purposes. This ensures that automated tests can simulate user interactions seamlessly.

IMPORTANT: The password input is neither stored nor cached. It is utilized only for the duration of the function call. Implementing memory safety mechanisms, such as zeroing out the memory or ensuring the content isn't swapped to disk, is essential.

==== Create Account

This function allows the user to create a new account. It generates a new key pair (private key and public key),
encrypts the private key with the user inputted password,
and stores it in a file on the file system.

==== Import Account

This function allows the user to import an account from a private key or from a .yaml file.

The file must follow the Massa Labs standard available https://github.com/massalabs/massa-standards/blob/main/wallet/file-format.md[here].

==== Seal Private Key

Encrypt the private key with the user inputted password, following the process and algorithms described in the Massa Labs standard available https://github.com/massalabs/massa-standards/blob/main/wallet/file-format.md[here].

==== Unseal Private Key

For certain operations, the encrypted and stored private key must be decrypted or "unsealed". This function manages the decryption process, ensuring compliance with the cryptographic constraints specified in the Massa Labs standard available https://github.com/massalabs/massa-standards/blob/main/wallet/file-format.md[here].

IMPORTANT: The unsealed private key is neither stored nor cached. It is utilized only for the duration of the function call. Implementing memory safety mechanisms, such as zeroing out the memory or ensuring the content isn't swapped to disk, is essential.

==== Save Account File

This function saves the account file to the file system. It ensures that the file is stored in the correct location and adheres to the Massa Labs standard available https://github.com/massalabs/massa-standards/blob/main/wallet/file-format.md[here].

==== Generate Message Signature

To sign a message, the content undergoes hashing using the Blake3 algorithm. The hashed value is subsequently signed using the ED25519 signature scheme. This function ensures the message signature process aligns with the Massa Labs cryptography standard.

==== Verify Signature

This function verifies the validity of a signature. It ensures that the signature was generated using the private key associated with the public key provided in the request.

==== Backup Account

This function allows the user to see its private key in clear.

User is prompted it's password to authenticate.

==== Add Asset

This function add an asset. Assets are fungible tokens. Address of the fungible token smart contract is stored in a JSON file.

==== Update Assets File

This low level function updates the assets file.

==== Generate Private Key

This function generates a new key pair (private key and public key).

==== Delete Account

This function allows the user to delete an account. It delete the account file from the file system.

User is prompted it's password to authenticate.

== Non-Functional Requirements

=== Performance Requirements:
**1. Response Time:**
The Massa Wallet module has a responsive user interface, with an
 average response time for most user actions (e.g., sending funds, 
checking balances), not exceeding 1 second.

**2. Scalability:**
The module is able to handle a growing number of transactions and users by design. 
All wallet components, including the API, run locally on the user's computer, so each user have API instance.

**3. Resource Utilization:**
The module is resource-efficient, consuming no more than 100 MB of RAM and 1% of CPU utilization 
during typical usage. During periods of inactivity or when the wallet is idle, resource utilization is near 0%.

=== Security Requirements:

**1. Data Encryption:**
All sensitive user data, such as private keys, are encrypted both at 
rest, and during signing process of an operation or a message. See https://github.com/massalabs/massa-standards/blob/main/wallet/file-format.md[the wallet file standard] for details.

**2. Backup and Recovery:**
Users have the ability to create backups of their wallet 
data, including private keys. In case of data loss, the module  
provides a secure and user-friendly recovery process. 

1. By providing previously exported and stored private key of the wallet. 

2. By attaching .yaml file of the wallet. 
**describe where are they stored per OS**

IMPORTANT: After a successful uninstallation, the user's computer must retain the Wallet .yaml files.

<<<

=== Other Requirements:

**1. Cross-Platform Compatibility:** 
Massa Wallet is compatible with major desktop operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- MacOs ARM
- MacOs AMD
- Ubuntu 20.4

Massa Wallet runs on Chromium-based and Firefox browsers.
Supported browser versions:

1. Chromium version -> **Identify Chromium version supported, list browser versions for main chromium-based browsers**

2. Firefox version 114 and higher.

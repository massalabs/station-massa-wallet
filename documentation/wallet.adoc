== Functional Requirements

=== API

The API will adhere to the HTML REST JSON standard, utilizing classic HTTP responses to indicate the status and nature of each response.

NOTE: For hands-on testing and examples, refer to the provided Swagger documentation and consider using tools like Postman.

==== Sign (operation) Endpoint

This endpoint serves the purpose of signing all five operation 
types, including Transaction, Roll buy/sell, CallSC, and 
ExecuteSC. It also provides the capability to batch operations by 
utilizing the correlationID parameter.

===== Parameters

[%header,cols="1,3,1,1"]
|===
| Name | Description | Presence | Format
| `nickname` | Identifier for the account. | Required | String
| `description` | Text describing the signing intent. | Optional | String (Default: "", Max: 280 characters)
| `operation` | Serialized attributes for signing. | Required | Byte string
| `batch` | Specifies if the operation is part of a batch. | Optional | Boolean (Default: `false`)
| `correlationId` | Identifier for correlating multiple requests. | Optional | String (Default: "")
|===


IMPORTANT: To ensure security, the `correlationId` should be sent in the request body, not in the query string.
===== Response

On successful execution, the response will the signature, public key, and correlationId (if provided).

==== Sign Message Endpoint

This endpoint facilitates the signing of a message using a 
specific account resource, identified by its unique nickname. It's 
important to note that this endpoint is not idempotent: identical 
calls with the same data will initiate separate executions.

===== Parameters

[%header,cols="1,3,1,1"]
|===
| Name | Description | Presence | Format
| `nickname` | Identifier for the account. | Required | String
| `description` | Text describing the signing intent. | Optional | String (Default: "", Max: 280 characters)
| `message` | **tbd** | Optional/Required |**define type**
| `DisplayData` | to be defined)
|===


===== Response

On successful execution, the response will return the signature and public key of the signed message.

=== Functions

==== Validate Arguments

This function ensures that arguments provided to any endpoint are correct and conform to the expected format. It checks for the presence of required parameters, validates data types, and ensures compliance with any constraints or limits.

==== Account Data

Account data is persistently stored on the file system. The structure and format of this data must strictly adhere to the standards outlined in the Massa Labs documentation, specifically the wallet file format standard available [here](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-standards/blob/main/wallet/file-format.md).

==== Password Input

This function captures the user's password input. It is designed with flexibility in mind, accommodating both manual user entry and automated input for testing purposes. This ensures that automated tests can simulate user interactions seamlessly.

IMPORTANT: The password input is neither stored nor cached. It is utilized only for the duration of the function call. Implementing memory safety mechanisms, such as zeroing out the memory or ensuring the content isn't swapped to disk, is essential.

==== Unseal Private Key

For certain operations, the encrypted and stored private key must be decrypted or "unsealed". This function manages the decryption process, ensuring compliance with the cryptographic constraints specified in the Massa Labs standard available [here](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-standards/blob/main/wallet/file-format.md).

IMPORTANT: The unsealed private key is neither stored nor cached. It is utilized only for the duration of the function call. Implementing memory safety mechanisms, such as zeroing out the memory or ensuring the content isn't swapped to disk, is essential.

==== Generate Message Signature

To sign a message, the content undergoes hashing using the Blake3 algorithm. The hashed value is subsequently signed using the ED25519 signature scheme. This function ensures the message signature process aligns with the Massa Labs cryptography standard.

== Non-Functional Requirements
=== Performance Requirements:
** 1. Response Time:**
The Massa Wallet module has a responsive user interface, with an
 average response time for any user action (e.g., sending funds, 
checking balances), not exceeding 2 seconds.

**2. Scalability:**
The module is able to handle a growing number of transactions and users by design. 
All wallet components, including the API, run locally on the user's computer, so each user have API instance.
*The scalability bottleneck is on the node side; if 10,000 users
request to do an operation at the same time on the same node,
it may be a problem for Massa Wallet users.*

**3. Resource Utilization:**
The module is resource-efficient, consuming no more than 100 MB of RAM and 1% of CPU utilization 
during typical usage. During periods of inactivity or when the wallet is idle, resource utilization is near 0%.

=== Security Requirements:

**1. Data Encryption:**
All sensitive user data, such as private keys and transaction history, are encrypted both at 
rest and during transmission. 

**name Industry-standard encryption protocols, and link to their usage.**

**2. Authentication and Authorization:**
Users are required to authenticate using password, or follow the recovery process to restore wallet accounts. 

**Define rules for password authorization mechanism here** 


**3. Protection Against Cyberattacks:** 

**to add**

**4. Backup and Recovery:**
Users have the ability to create backups of their wallet 
data, including private keys. In case of data loss, the module  
provides a secure and user-friendly recovery process. 
1. By providing previously exported and stored private key of the wallet. 
2. By attaching .yaml file of the wallet. 
**describe where are they stored per OS**

IMPORTANT: After a successful uninstallation, the user's computer retains the Wallet .yaml files.

=== Other Requirements:

**1. Compliance with Cryptocurrency Standards:** 

**To which industry standards and best practices, 
do we adhere?**

**2. Cross-Platform Compatibility:** 
Massa Wallet is compatible with major desktop operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
**List versions of OSs**

Massa Wallet runs on Chromium and Firefox browsers.
